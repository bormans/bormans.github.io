        <h1 align = "center">Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors</h1>

        <img src = align "center" "http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/561/458/hi-res-7ce2ee5dbb0c2e7c29625610e4bfd32f_crop_north.jpg?w=630&h=420&q=75">

<div class = "container">
        <br><p> The 2014 league MVP, 2013 scoring champion, and new addition to the "best team in the NBA".
          Kevin Durant is an absolute freak of nature at the small forward position. Durant has every tool imaginable,
          given his size (6'9", 240 lbs), strength, speed, instincts and skill.
          He's a matchup nightmare for any defender,
          and he nearly joined the 50/40/90 club again while averaging 28.2 points and creating much of his own offense.</p>

          <p> In this year's offseason, Kevin Durant chose to part ways with the team that drafted him, the team that made
            him, the Oklahoma City Thunder, and with that, his dynamic point guard, Russell Westbrook.</p>

            <p> Coming to the Warriors will impact his game, and Durant knows that. He won't average the
              same amount of points he is used to scoring on a nightly basis, since now he will have to share the load
              with the 2-time defending league MVP, Stephen Curry, a prolific sharpshooter on the wing, Klay Thompson, and
              the "point-forward", stretch-four, defensive monster, Draymond Green. One statistic that will increase
              will be his rebounding. The Warriors have a "small-ball" team, and Durant enters the team being one of the tallest
              members.<p>

                <p> Even though Durant will not be getting as many points as he normally would with the Thunder,
                  he's still Kevin Durant. He is still going to be a major threat on both ends of the court,
                  and look for him to make a huge splash come this NBA season.</p>
