        <h1>Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors</h1>
        <br><p> If you went into a lab to engineer a player who could score more effectively than Kevin Durant,
          your ideal model would probably be an inferior version. Durant has every tool imaginable,
          given his size (6'9", 240 lbs), strength, speed, instincts and skill.
          He's a matchup nightmare for any defender,
          and he nearly joined the 50/40/90 club again while averaging 28.2 points and creating much of his own offense.</p></br>
