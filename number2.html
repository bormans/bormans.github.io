        <br><p> It was only a matter of time before this man showed up. Stephen Curry, the two-time defending league MVP, and 3-point
         magician. </p>

          <p> Averaging a league-best 30.1 points per game while shooting 50.4 percent from the field, 45.4 percent
            from downtown and an NBA-leading 90.8 percent from the charity stripe? Shattering his own three-point
            record by making an additional 116 threes? Hitting 69.6 percent of his shots from inside three feet?
             Stephen Curry's scoring was as close to perfect as one could get. </p>

            <p>Curry will never be a Defensive Player of the Year candidate, but he was one of the league's
              best defensive point guards in 2015-16. His quick hands, strong core and knack for
              forcing his assignment into the right spot helped immensely.  </p>

                <p> The only reason why I am putting Stephen Curry at number two is because of the newly acquired superstar,
                Kevin Durant. Yes, Curry will still average over 20 points a game, along with a healthy amount of assists,
              but overall his stats will decrease with the addition of Durant, who is one of the league's most prolific scorers and
            incredible come crunch-time. </p>

                <p>Curry was the clear-cut MVP, even becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.
                  Setting three-point records, he redefined what the league viewed as quality offense, asserted himself as the
                  world's best point guard... but not the world's best player, at least for this upcoming season. </p>
