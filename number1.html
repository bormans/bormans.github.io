        <br><p> The best player in the NBA, at least for the upcoming NBA season, is the King himself, the reigning Finals MVP, the hometown hero, Lebron James. </p>

          <p> Even though his assist totals don't match the league leaders, James may be the NBA's best passer. His
            ability to make cross-court feeds and hit his targets perfectly while barreling to the basket at full speed is unsurpassed.  </p>

            <p> Even when it seems like James isn't on his game, he somehow always ends to provide an amazing performance.
            It doesn't matter who he is playing with, he has and always will make the players around him better just by being on the
          court with them.  </p>

                <p> Will anyone ever stop LeBron James? Apparently nothing can, since just last season James brought his team back in the
                Finals from a 3-1 deficit to win it all and finally bring a championship to Cleveland. Oh, and I forgot to mention,
              he did it against the Golden State Warriors, who during the regular season went 73-9 and beat the 1996 Chicago Bulls'
            regular season win record and looked unstoppable moving into the postseason, after winning last year's NBA Finals. </p>

                <p>When James leaves it all on the court, as he did while steering the Cavaliers to their historic
                   come-from-behind NBA title, there's no one better. Even when he's pacing himself during the regular season, he's a
                   once-in-a-lifetime presence. This forward simply does everything well, with the lone exception of perimeter shooting.
                    And though that's such a key part of modern offense, it almost doesn't matter for a player who can get to the rim at will
                    during and beyond his age-31 season.  </p>
