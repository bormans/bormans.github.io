        <br><p> At number four it is non other than Kevin Durant's ex-partner, Russell Westbrook. He's the reigning
        NBA scoring champion, and look out, this man's out for blood.</p>

          <p> Good luck stopping Russell Westbrook.
            Despite his unreliable perimeter jumper,
            the Oklahoma City Thunder point guard is a true scoring force.
            No one can keep him from getting to the basket in transition, or the half-court set,
            for that matter, and his ability to rack up free throws is the cherry on top. </p>

            <p> This man was a triple-double machine... While Durant was on the team! Westbrook, now
            the leader of the Thunder, will only average more points, assists, rebounds, and steals. </p>

                <p> The only real downside to Westbrook's game is his shooting. His mid-range game at times can be spot
                on, but other times he can't find the bottom of the net unless it's from a layup or dunk.</p>

                <p> That's the thing with Westbrook though, the man has incredible athleticism. Some say he is the most
                  ferocious dunker that has ever played the point guard position, and looking at his highlights, I can't completely
                  disagree.</p>

                  <p> With Durant gone, look for Westbrook to carry the load offensively, and finally have the keys to the ignition
                    and completely take over OKC. Don't be surprised if he wins MVP, he just may carry his team very far into the postseason,
                    with his agressive style of play. </p>
