        <br><p> At number three we have the future of the San Antonio Spurs, Kawhi Leonard.
          In his fifth season, he averaged 21.2 points on 50.6 percent from the field,
          44.3 percent from downtown and 87.4 percent at the stripe. Leonard is also now on the verge of joining the
          50/40/90 club along with being one of the best defenders in the entire league. </p>

          <p> Even though the award is traditionally reserved for big men, Leonard has now won Defensive Player of the
            Year during each of the last two seasons. He's as close as it gets in a league where no player is a perfect defender
            against NBA-caliber wings.  </p>

            <p> Leonard won Finals MVP when the Spurs beat the Heat in the 2014 NBA Finals. That was just the start of this man's
            rise to stardom. Last year he was voted as a starter for the West All-Star Team after having an amazing
          first half of last season. Now, not only is he known for his defense, but his offense as well, being a great shooter
        and a slasher with amazing bounce and athleticism. </p>

                <p> Kawhi Leonard is a stat-stuffer. Simple as that. He easily scores over 20 points, and with the retirement
                of the legendary Tim Duncan, his stats are only going to increase. For anyone interested in Fantasy Basketball,
              this guy is a must-have. </p>

                <p> He's still young, and he has so much potential to grow to be one of the best small forwards to ever play
                the game. He is now the leader of an aged Spurs team, and being given the keys this early in his career
              will only lead to more progress in his basketball skills. He'll be up there in MVP voting this year, I can guarantee it. </p>
