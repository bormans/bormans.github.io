	 Hi my name is Stephen Borman and I am a student at the University at Buffalo. I am a CS major, and enjoy playing video games, watching and playing sports, and going out with friends. I played volleyball and baseball in high school and I am recovering from a tear in my shoulder that was caused by playing these sports.
